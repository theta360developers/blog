You can stream live 360° events to Facebook and YouTube using the THETA V.
First, connect the THETA to the Internet with Wi-Fi or Ethernet, then use
the new Wireless Live Streaming plug-in to stream directly from the camera
to either YouTube or Facebook.

Prior to this new technique, people needed to use a mobile phone or laptop 
to connect to the THETA with a USB cable. Now, you can stream events directly
with no additional streaming equipment.

A free user guide is available [here](http://theta360.guide/plugin/) that covers all the steps in detail. This article provides a short overview to get you started quickly.

## Setup

This example shows configuration for YouTube. The [user guide]((http://theta360.guide/plugin/)) also includes a step-by-step guide for
Facebook. If you're eager to get started with streaming to Facebook, 
I summarized the main points of Facebook
configuration in [this](http://theta360.guide/blog/streaming/2018/07/31/facebook-wireless.html) blog post.

### Overview of Steps

1. Download plug-in from THETA Store
1. Install plug-in in camera
1. Create Live 360° Event on YouTube
1. Connect camera to an Internet router (Wi-Fi hotspot)
1. Use web browser to configure camera with YouTube streaming settings
1. Launch your Live 360° event and party

Downloading and installing the plug-in is the same process for all plug-ins. See 
the user guide for details. Steps specific to YouTube Live Events are shown below.

If you want confirmation that everything is working, you can
go back to your YouTube control room and make sure the stream is
working.

You can now make your event live to all your subscribers.

Now that you've configured the event, you can start and 
stop the stream by pressing the shutter button.
