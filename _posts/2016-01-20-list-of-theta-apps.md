* [PTGui](http://www.ptgui.com) tool for straightening panos and posting panos  
 Dennis Mabrey says, "While PTGui is a great tool it's primary purpose is for stitching multiple images into a pano."


* [Pano2VR](http://ggnome.com) tool for straightening panos and creating tour  
Dennis Mabrey says, "PanoVR (at least beta ver 5) will perform automatic straightening of Theta/Theta S images. You don't have to run the stills through the Ricoh software.  
PanoVR also is great for things like tripod removal or fixing images. You can select a portion of the image and edit in Photoshop and perform functions like content aware fill. Really makes getting rid of the tripod or the 'giant hand' very useful."
