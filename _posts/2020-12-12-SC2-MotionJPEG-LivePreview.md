Viewer for MotionJPEG stream from RICOH THETA SC2

Tested with firmware 1.31


## Landscape Mode 

![landscape mode screenshot](/blog/img/2020-12/motion_6.gif)

MotionJPEG demo on Android AVD displaying video on laptop to show how the app can display motion.  
Imagine you have the THETA SC2 out capturing a real surf scene instead of a simulated
session on a laptop.

## Portrait Mode

Portrait mode adds buttons to change the fps for testing.
Elapsed time since the start of the MotionJPEG test session is
also displayed.

Elapsed time is useful to test if the MotionJPEG stream stops.
The stream did not stop in my tests unless another command
such as take picture was given.

## ToDo

- Rewrite app to isolate updating of stateful widgets, which may improve updating. Though, it seems
to work great now with the gaplessPlayback and precacheImage implementation
- change fps button color when selected.
- figure out why app only works on SC2 and not on V/Z1.  The http request doesn't return
the same result on V/Z1. For the V/Z1, I built a different app
using the dart:io HttpClient() instead of the 
http package.


## Tips for Smooth Playback

### gaplessPlayback

Implemented 
[gaplessPlayback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image/gaplessPlayback.html) property.

### precacheImage

I used [precacheImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/precacheImage.html) to eliminate a white flickering problem.  
I'm not sure when the cache is cleared or if the physical 
device will run out of memory.  I've tested it for continous streaming for 10 minutes.


```dart
Image cachedImage = Image.memory(
  Uint8List.fromList(
    buf.sublist(73, buf.length),
  ),
);
precacheImage(cachedImage.image, context);
setState(() {
  frameImage = cachedImage;
});
```

## Packaging and Release

- Attempt to use [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)
- [Android deployment](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android)
- release files are in `/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk`

modern Android phones such as Google Pixel should use `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`

```
app.apk       app-arm64-v8a-release.apk    app-debug.apk
app.apk.sha1  app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk  app-x86_64-release.apk
```
