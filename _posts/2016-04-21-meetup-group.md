Within a week of forming our
[meetup group for THETA developers](http://www.meetup.com/RICOH-THETA-Developers-SF-Bay-Area/events/230383770/),
88 people joined us. We've changed the format to provide help to win some of the
$45,000 in prizes for the
[RICOH THETA x IoT Developers Contest](http://theta360.guide/contest/).

In addition to the RICOH API to control the camera, participants can
access a number of pre-release technologies from the
[RICOH Cloud API (Beta)](http://docs.ricohapi.com/) group.

* [Cloud-based media storage REST API](https://github.com/ricohapi/media-storage-rest)
* [Video streaming sample application](https://github.com/ricohapi/video-streaming-sample-app)
