Using the video tutorial on [using 360 images in Unity for augmented reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-MoLjcYmi8)
and [blog post](http://theta360.guide/blog/unity/2016/10/22/tutorial-unity-360-image-sphere.html), you can use 360
images as a background to your augmented reality project.

To illustrate the ease of creating Unity projects, I took my pre-teen daughter to
Stanford University Cantor Arts Center and asked her to take pictures with a THETA
S.

Back at home, I showed her how to import 3D assets into her 360 photo scenes.

Starting with a THETA image of rocks, she dropped it into the background
and added free 3D assets from [Archive3D](http://archive3d.net/).

This is the original image.

These are screenshots from the 3D scene she created.

Outside of the museum, she took a picture of a field.

At home, she added additional 3D assets.
